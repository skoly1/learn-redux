## üî• Redux Core Concepts Explained

### 1. Actions

**Actions** are plain JavaScript objects that describe "what happened" in your application. They must have a `type` property and optionally a `payload`.

```typescript
// Simple action (no payload)
const incrementAction = {
  type: 'counter/increment'
};

// Action with payload
const addTodoAction = {
  type: 'todos/addTodo',
  payload: 'Learn Redux'
};
```

**Action Creators** are functions that return action objects:

```typescript
// Action creator for increment
export const increment = () => ({
  type: 'counter/increment'
});

// Action creator with payload
export const addTodo = (text: string) => ({
  type: 'todos/addTodo',
  payload: text
});
```

### 2. Reducers

**Reducers** are pure functions that take the current state and an action, and return a new state. They must never mutate the original state.

```typescript
const counterReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'counter/increment':
      return {
        ...state,              // Spread existing state
        value: state.value + 1 // Update only what changed
      };
    default:
      return state; // Always return current state for unknown actions
  }
};
```

**Key Rules for Reducers:**
- Must be pure functions (no side effects)
- Must not mutate state (always return new objects/arrays)
- Must return the current state for unknown actions

### 3. Store

The **Store** holds the complete state tree of your application. There should only be a single store.

```typescript
import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  counter: counterReducer,
  todos: todoReducer
});

const store = createStore(rootReducer);
```

### 4. Dispatch

**Dispatch** is the only way to trigger a state change. You dispatch actions to the store.

```typescript
store.dispatch(increment());
store.dispatch(addTodo('Learn Redux'));
```

## ‚öõÔ∏è React-Redux Integration

### Provider Component

The `Provider` makes the Redux store available to all React components:

```typescript
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './store';

<Provider store={store}>
  <App />
</Provider>
```

### useSelector Hook

`useSelector` allows you to extract data from the Redux store state:

```typescript
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

const Counter = () => {
  // Extract specific data from state
  const count = useSelector(state => state.counter.value);
  
  return <div>Count: {count}</div>;
};
```

### useDispatch Hook

`useDispatch` gives you access to the dispatch function:

```typescript
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { increment } from '../store/slices/counterSlice';

const Counter = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  
  const handleIncrement = () => {
    dispatch(increment()); // Dispatch the action
  };
  
  return <button onClick={handleIncrement}>+</button>;
};
```

## üîß Advanced Concepts

### Selectors

**Selectors** are functions that extract and compute derived state from the Redux store:

```typescript
// Simple selector
export const selectCounterValue = (state) => state.counter.value;

// Computed selector
export const selectIsEven = (state) => state.counter.value % 2 === 0;

// Complex selector with filtering
export const selectActiveTodos = (state) => 
  state.todos.todos.filter(todo => !todo.completed);
```

**Benefits of Selectors:**
- Encapsulate state access logic
- Can be reused across components
- Enable computed/derived state
- Improve performance with memoization

### Immutable Updates

Redux requires all state updates to be immutable. Here are common patterns:

#### Updating Objects
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Correct - create new object
return {
  ...state,
  value: state.value + 1
};

// ‚ùå Wrong - mutating state
state.value += 1;
return state;
```

#### Updating Arrays
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Adding items
return {
  ...state,
  todos: [...state.todos, newTodo]
};

// ‚úÖ Removing items
return {
  ...state,
  todos: state.todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== actionId)
};

// ‚úÖ Updating items
return {
  ...state,
  todos: state.todos.map(todo =>
    todo.id === actionId 
      ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed }
      : todo
  )
};
```

## üìö Example Analysis

### Counter Slice (Simple Example)

The counter slice demonstrates basic Redux concepts:

- **4 Action Types**: increment, decrement, incrementByAmount, reset
- **Simple State**: Just a number value and last action
- **Basic Actions**: Most actions have no payload
- **Straightforward Reducers**: Simple mathematical operations

**Key Learning Points:**
- How to structure a basic slice
- Action creators with and without payloads
- Basic state updates
- Simple selectors

### Todo Slice (Complex Example)

The todo slice demonstrates advanced Redux patterns:

- **8 Action Types**: Complex CRUD operations and filtering
- **Complex State**: Array of objects plus filter and search state
- **Varied Payloads**: Strings, objects, enums
- **Advanced Reducers**: Array manipulations, filtering logic

**Key Learning Points:**
- Managing arrays of objects
- Complex state updates
- Filtering and searching patterns
- Computed selectors
- Real-world application structure

## üöÄ Running the Application

1. **Install Dependencies**

   - Build a "settings" slice for user preferences

6. **Cross-Slice Logic**
   - Make todos filterable by current user
   - Add user-specific counters
   - Implement user preferences affecting display

## üîç Debugging Tips

### Redux DevTools

1. **Time Travel Debugging**
   - Click on any action in the history
   - See exactly how state changed
   - Jump back and forth through actions

2. **State Inspector**
   - View current state tree
   - Inspect individual state slices
   - Monitor state changes in real-time

3. **Action Monitoring**
   - See all dispatched actions
   - View action payloads
   - Trace action dispatch origins

### Common Issues

1. **State Not Updating**
   - Check if reducer is returning new state object
   - Verify action type strings match exactly
   - Ensure dispatch is being called

2. **Component Not Re-rendering**
   - Verify useSelector is selecting the correct state slice
   - Check if state reference actually changed
   - Ensure component is wrapped in Provider

3. **Actions Not Working**
   - Verify action creators return proper action objects
   - Check action type constants for typos
   - Ensure dispatch is connected properly

## üéì Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive foundation for understanding Redux. Study the code, experiment with changes, and use the Redux DevTools to see how everything works together. The patterns demonstrated here will serve as a solid foundation for building more complex Redux applications.

Remember: Redux might seem complex at first, but it's just a predictable state container. Once you understand the core concepts of actions, reducers, and the store, everything else builds upon these fundamentals.
